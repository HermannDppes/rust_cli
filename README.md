## rust_cli

Command line(cli) follows a command patterns where a command manager attaches all the subcommands it needs to process. There are standard flags (-v version, -h help) that are written as part of the cli.

rust-cli is a mixin for creating command line applications - gives an easy interface for argument specification and processing used by https://console.megam.io

So we grabbed the best practice from `cargo` which will be used as a common library in our cli`s (servers to anything...).
You can see `rust-turbo` in action in our cli [meg](https://github.com/megamsys/meg.git) for launching [Megam](https://www.megam.io).
